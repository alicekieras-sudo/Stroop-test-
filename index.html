    <p class="text">For one minute, you will be shown coloured words. 
      Some of these words will be accurate to the colour

    <p class="text" style="padding-top: 10px;">Your task is to name the colour of the word, not the
       meaning of the word. For example, when shown <span class="green">GREEN</span>, you
        will select green, when shown <span class="red">BLUE</span>, you will select 
        red. The word will appear on the screen and there will 
        be five buttons below (red, blue, yellow, green, and black), 
        you will need to press the right one.</p>

      these points won’t be taken away if you make a mistake 
      however it will be saved.</p>

<h2 class="center">Disclaimer</h2>
  <p class="center">If it’s obvious you were just spamming, your results will 
  not be considered and then trashed. </p>
  <p class="center">If the form submitted has information that doesn’t 
    match up (e.g. you put your year as S4 as an S1), your 
    results will be not considered and then trashed. </p>
  <p class="center">You may try to do the test again, but obvious second 
    attempts will not be considered and then trashed. </p>
  <p class="center">Your words will be different from the person sitting next 
    to you, so you can’t cheat and if you try, you will not be 
    considered and then you will be trashed. </p>
  <p class="center">Thank you for participating! :)</p>
